## Challenges and Wins

### Challenges
- Time! Working on this project outside of work hours and around our lives was difficult.
- Naivety - we underestimated the work that goes into even developing a simple application.
- CSS is a lot more fiddly than we remembered!
- Finding new technologies to host server and client apps after our usual techs have been discontinued (or removed free options!)

### Wins

- Server side testing and coverage was great.
- Theme, design and feel of the app is where we want it.
- Project structure, planning and workflow created a successful first draft of app.
